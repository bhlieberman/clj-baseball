# `clj-baseball`

This is a Clojure library inspired by Python's `pybaseball`. It scrapes HTML data on baseball websites and makes it friendly to work with at the REPL. For an initial alpha release, the goal is to have fast queries by player, team, and league. In further updates, I hope to add (possible) features such as Spark dataframes and other goodies. Stay tuned!
